# IFT-714-NLP-
NLP project as part of the unit IFT714 "Natural Language Processing" at the University of Sherbrooke

# Instructions

The different libraries of our projects are available in the requirements.txt files. You would need to install them with "pip install -r requirements.txt". 

In the project we use the NLTK library which can ask to download documents. Then run the following commands in the Jupyter notebook: 

- nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
- nltk.download('vader_lexicon')
- nltk.download('universal_tagset')
- nltk.download('stopwords')
  
You can then navigate in our jupyter notebook and run the different cells to interact with our code.
